}
Responses - Messages Endpoint
Responses follow the standard Sprout API response format:

data

This array contains the message's data requested in JSON format.

paging(optional)

This object, if present, indicates there are still more pages of data to be fetched, and provides a cursor pointing to the next page of data:

Key	Description	Example Value
next_cursor	String of alphanumeric characters representing the next page of data, sorted by message created_time	"abcd1234=="
Messages Request Limits & Pagination
message_id(filters): maximum of 100 messages per request

Pagination of response is based on the following request params:

limit- number of messages returned per response (max: 100, default: 50)
sort- sort order of messages in response; sorted by message created_time(default: desc)
To paginate results: continuously fetch the "next" page of data, by updating the page_cursorparameter, until a response without a pagingobject is returned

Note: Unlike some other Sprout API Endpoints, index-based paging (e.g. page: 4) is not supported by the Messages Endpoint. While you can specify the sortdirection, you can only ever get the "next" page of data — you can't fetch the "previous" page

A Request containing an invalid page_cursorwill return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response with a message describing the error

Response Data - Messages Endpoint
Example response:

{
  "data": [
    {
      "post_category": "POST",
      "post_type": "INSTAGRAM_MEDIA",
      "profile_guid": "placeholder",

          {
            "id": 1234
          },
          {

    },
    ...
  ],
  "paging": {
    "next_cursor": "456def=="
  }
}  
Listening Endpoints
Listening endpoints are all HTTP POST endpoints. They provide access to your Listening Topic data, including:

Messages - Enables you to query for messages within a given Topic.
Metrics - Aggregates data across the Topic.
Overview
All requests to and responses from Listening API endpoints have a similar structure.

Requests - Listening Endpoints
The request body for a Listening API request is a JSON object with the following name/values pairs:

Key	Description	Example Value
filters	Detailed filters used to filter the results by message created_timeand network. To learn more about advanced filters for Topics see the Filters section.	["created_time.in(2018-01-01...2018-02-01)"]
metrics	List of metrics to return in results; refer to the metrics	["impressions", "likes"]
fields	List of fields to return in results; at least one field is required for Listening messages endpoint. Refer to the Listening Message Fields section for full list of valid fields	["content_category", "created_time", "from.name"]
page
(optional)	In paginated results, which 1-indexed page to return in the response.
Pagination is based on default limits of 50 results	3
limit
(optional)	Specifies the max number of results per page in the response. Defaults to 50 results for the Listening endpoints.	100
sort
(optional)	Sets the sort order for results, specified as a list of fields and directions (ascor desc) in the format <field>:<direction>.	["created_time:asc"]
timezone
(optional)	Time zone—from the ICANN time zone database. Timezone arguments only impact date/time-related filters, responses are not impacted and are always in UTC for posts.	"America/Chicago"
dimensions
(optional)	(Topic Metrics endpoints only)
Breaks down metrics into discrete buckets. See Dimensions section to learn what fields work with dimensions.	["created_time.by(day)", "sentiment"]
Filters - Listening Endpoints
Filtering is a powerful query mechanism that allows you to isolate data within your Topics. You can combine most fields or metrics with the operators below to produce filter to specific data sets using the Topic Messages or Topic Metric endpoints.

Operator	Description	Example Value
gt	Greater than	likes.gt(10)
gte	Greater than or equal to	engagement_total.gte(5)
lt	Less than	replies.lt(5)
lte	Less than or equal to	impressions.lte(1000)
in	Specifies a range. A helper that circumvents needed to use a filter with both gt and lt. Using .. is inclusive of the end value while ... is not. Dates and timestamps are accepted. Dates without timestamps are interpreted as midnight of that date, i.e. 2022-06-09 is treated as 2022-06-09T00:00:00.	created_time.in(2023-05-01…2023-06-01T23:59:59)
eq	Equals a particular value. Can contain multiple comma separated values. If multiple values are provided, the filter returns data containing at least one value.	network.eq(TWITTER,INSTAGRAM)
neq	The opposite of eq.	network.neq(FACEBOOK)
exists	Either true or false. Filter finds (or not) messages that meet the criteria of having a value (or not).	visual_media.exists(true)
match	Performs a text search query on a specified field. Multiple comma terms can be provided using spaces, wrap phrases or multiple words in quotes. Messages must match all provided terms. If you want a message that matches any single term, place an OR between terms (e.g. blue OR red).	text.match(blue OR red)
text.match(“the blue car”)
text.match(blue red green)
You can apply multiple filters where data must meet all requirements by adding filters to the filters array. An example request using multiple filters:

{
  "filters": [
   "created_time.in(2022-11-28..2022-12-29T23:59:59)",
   "text.match(blue car)",
   "network.eq(INSTAGRAM,YOUTUBE,LINKEDIN,REDDIT,TUMBLR,WWW,TIKTOK)"
 ]
}
Responses - Listening Endpoints
Due to greater variability in response length, only the Messages endpoint supports paging. The Metrics endpoint does not support paging, and returns all data in a single response.

Responses follow the standard data API response format:

data

This array contains the Listening data requested. See specific endpoints for additional details.

paging

This object specifies the state of paging for this response:

Key	Description	Example Value
current_page	1-indexed page number of the response	3
total_pages	Total number of pages for the request	20
A pagingobject is always returned, including when the response contains all data in one page. You can rely on checking for current_page = total_pagesin order to know when you are at the end of the paging sequence.

Requesting a page greater than total_pages will return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response with a message describing the error.

Dimensions - Listening Endpoints
Dimensions are a powerful tool that allow you to slice and bucket Topic metrics. The most common uses for dimensions would be generating metrics over time (e.g. a trend chart) or breaking down metrics by metadata such as sentiment score. The following Topic fields can be used as a dimension.

created_time.by(day)
created_time.by(month)
visual_media.media_type
distribution_type
network
sentiment
language
explicit_label
location.city
location.province
location.country
Here is an example of multiple dimensions being used to create a trend chart of sentiment data over time:

{
  "filters": [
  "created_time.in(2022-11-28..2022-11-30)",
  "network.eq(INSTAGRAM,YOUTUBE,LINKEDIN,REDDIT,TUMBLR,WWW,TIKTOK)"
  ],
  "metrics": [
    "replies",
    "shares_count",
    "likes"
  ],
  "dimensions": [
    "created_time.by(day)",
    "sentiment"
  ],
  "timezone": "America/Chicago"
}
Here is a sample output of this query:

{
    "data": [
        {
            "dimensions": {
                "created_time": "2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00",
                "sentiment": "positive"
            },
            "metrics": {
                "replies": 29.0,
                "shares_count": 5.0,

            }
        },
        {
            "dimensions": {
                "created_time": "2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00",
                "sentiment": "neutral"
            },
            "metrics": {
                "replies": 17.0,
                "shares_count": 5.0,
                "likes": 354.0
            }
        },
        {
            "dimensions": {
                "created_time": "2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00",
                "sentiment": "negative"
            },
            "metrics": {
                "replies": 49.0,
